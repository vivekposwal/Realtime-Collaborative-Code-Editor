Tagline of project: Realtime Collaborative Code Editor

Project Scope: Real-Time Collaborative Code Editor

1. Objective:
Develop a web-based code editor that supports real-time collaboration among multiple users.

2. Features:
Code Editing:
Syntax highlighting for various programming languages.
Prebuilt Template for various languages.
Code folding and indentation support.

Real-Time Collaboration:
Simultaneous editing for multiple users.
Live cursor tracking.
Instant updates on code changes made by others.

Compile and Run:
Integration with compilers/interpreters for code execution.
Real-time feedback on code compilation and execution.

Scalability:
Design the system to handle a scalable number of users and projects.

3. Technology Stack:
Frontend -- ReactJs, JavaScript, Bootstrap, Socket.io Client.
Backend -- ExpressJs, MongoDb, NodeJs , Socket.io.

4. Deployment:
Plan for deployment on scalable and reliable infrastructure (Netlify, Cyclic , Onrender).



Feasibility of a real-time collaborative code editor from various perspectives:

Technical Feasibility:
Server Architecture: Ensure that the server architecture can handle concurrent connections and real-time synchronization of code changes.
WebSockets or Alternative: Implement a technology like WebSockets for real-time communication between the server and clients, or explore suitable alternatives.

Financial Feasibility:
Development Costs: Estimate the costs associated with developing the collaborative code editor, including software development, testing, and infrastructure costs.
Maintenance Costs: Consider ongoing maintenance, updates, and support costs.
Return on Investment (ROI): Evaluate potential revenue streams or cost savings that can be achieved through the implementation of the collaborative code editor.

Schedule Feasibility:
Development Timeline: Develop a realistic timeline for the development and deployment of the collaborative code editor.
Parallel Development: Consider the possibility of parallel development to expedite the project without compromising quality.

Legal and Regulatory Feasibility:
Data Security and Privacy: Ensure compliance with data protection laws and implement robust security measures to protect user data.
