Tagline of project: Realtime Collaborative Code Editor

Project Scope: Real-Time Collaborative Code Editor

What is a Code Editor?
A text editor programme created especially for editing computer programmes' source code is known as a source-code editor. It might be integrated into an integrated development
environment or it might be a stand-alone programme.

1. Objective:
Develop a web-based code editor that supports real-time collaboration among multiple users.

2. Features:
Code Editing:
Syntax highlighting for various programming languages.
Prebuilt Template for various languages.
Code folding and indentation support.

Real-Time Collaboration:
Simultaneous editing for multiple users.
Live cursor tracking.
Instant updates on code changes made by others.

Compile and Run:
Integration with compilers/interpreters for code execution.
Real-time feedback on code compilation and execution.

Scalability:
Design the system to handle a scalable number of users and projects.

3. Technology Stack:
Frontend -- ReactJs, JavaScript, Bootstrap, Socket.io Client.
Backend -- ExpressJs, MongoDb, NodeJs , Socket.io.

4. Deployment:
Plan for deployment on scalable and reliable infrastructure (Netlify, Cyclic , Onrender).



Feasibility of a real-time collaborative code editor from various perspectives:

Technical Feasibility:
Server Architecture: Ensure that the server architecture can handle concurrent connections and real-time synchronization of code changes.
WebSockets or Alternative: Implement a technology like WebSockets for real-time communication between the server and clients, or explore suitable alternatives.

Financial Feasibility:
Development Costs: Estimate the costs associated with developing the collaborative code editor, including software development, testing, and infrastructure costs.
Maintenance Costs: Consider ongoing maintenance, updates, and support costs.
Return on Investment (ROI): Evaluate potential revenue streams or cost savings that can be achieved through the implementation of the collaborative code editor.

Schedule Feasibility:
Development Timeline: Develop a realistic timeline for the development and deployment of the collaborative code editor.
Parallel Development: Consider the possibility of parallel development to expedite the project without compromising quality.

Legal and Regulatory Feasibility:
Data Security and Privacy: Ensure compliance with data protection laws and implement robust security measures to protect user data.


Literature review of our project:

The normal code editor lets you edit the code in real time in our project we have added other features too that differs from normal code editor.
What we are proposing in our project:
In our real time code editor we can edit the code in real time with multiple users. We can also practice codeforces questions just by putting
the question id. Also we can discuss the question in real time with other users.
